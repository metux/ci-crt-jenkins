* make /var/lib/apt/lists a separate volume in order to not putting it into the main image
* pluggable extra init scripts (eg. start extra services)
* drop all X11 stuff (eg. use headless jre)
* drop all systemd stuff --> not needed
* put unpacked war into a separate volume or tmpfs
* why unpacked war at all ?
* move postgresql to separate container
* setup R4D VMs

NOTE:
    * master and docker slaves needs >1 concurrent jobs (otherwise stalls)
    * dont set to always pull image, otherwise fails if image is only local
